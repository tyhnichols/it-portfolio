🧭 WEEK 5: Ticketing Systems & Troubleshooting
Focus: Simulate IT support tickets and responses.
✅ Labs & Tasks
* Set up a mock ticketing system (e.g., Spiceworks Help Desk)
* Create and resolve tickets:
    * “Cannot print”
    * “No internet”
    * “Forgot password”
    * “Computer slow”
* Document steps: issue → diagnosis → resolution → response message
🛠 Tools: Spiceworks, Notion or Google Docs for tracking
